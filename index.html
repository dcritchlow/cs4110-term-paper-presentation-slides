						<h2>Symmetric</h2>
					</section>
					<section data-background="symmetricalgo.gif" data-background-size="900px">
						<aside class="notes">
							Symmetric encryption is the oldest and best-known technique. A secret key, which can be a number, a word, or just a string of random letters, is applied to the text of a message to change the content in a particular way. This might be as simple as shifting each letter by a number of places in the alphabet. As long as both sender and recipient know the secret key, they can encrypt and decrypt all messages that use this key.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Asymmetric</h2>
					</section>
					<section data-background="asymmetric-encryption.gif" data-background-size="1000px">
					<aside class="notes">
						The problem with secret keys is exchanging them over the Internet or a large network while preventing them from falling into the wrong hands. Anyone who knows the secret key can decrypt the message. One answer is asymmetric encryption, in which there are two related keys--a key pair. A public key is made freely available to anyone who might want to send you a message. A second, private key is kept secret, so that only you know it.

Any message (text, binary files, or documents) that are encrypted by using the public key can only be decrypted by applying the same algorithm, but by using the matching private key. Any message that is encrypted by using the private key can only be decrypted by using the matching public key.

This means that you do not have to worry about passing public keys over the Internet (the keys are supposed to be public). A problem with asymmetric encryption, however, is that it is slower than symmetric encryption. It requires far more processing power to both encrypt and decrypt the content of the message.
About Digital Certificates

To use asymmetric encryption, there must be a way for people to discover other public keys. The typical technique is to use digital certificates (also known simply as certificates). A certificate is a package of information that identifies a user or a server, and contains information such as the organization name, the organization that issued the certificate, the user's e-mail address and country, and the user's public key.

When a server and client require a secure encrypted communication, they send a query over the network to the other party, which sends back a copy of the certificate. The other party's public key can be extracted from the certificate. A certificate can also be used to uniquely identify the holder.

						<h2>How the Enigma works</h2>
						<img src="enigmawiringdiagram.png" width="900" height="550" alt="" />
						<aside class="notes">
							The first stop on the journey is the plugboard. Here the signal is connected to the 'T' input on the plugboard. Some of the letters on the plugboard will be wired up to other letters (the plugs), causing the signal to be diverted. If the 'T' input is not plugged to another letter then our signal will pass straight to the 'T output. In our case, though the 'T' is plugged to the 'K', so the signal is diverted to a new path, the letter is now 'K'. In our example, we are using rotor III in the right-hand position.

						</small>
						<aside class="notes">
							During the war, the Japanese were most efficient in destroying their encryption machines. Currently, not one complete Purple machine has been discovered. The Japanese Purple machine is based on the rotor technology of the Enigma, and the Japanese called it "97-shiki O-bun In-ji-ki", which means Alphabetical Typewriter '97. The 97 means the Japanese year 2597 which is 1937 to the Western world, the year it was developed. The Japanese commonly referred to it as "the machine" or "J", it was the US codebreakers that dubbed it "Purple", after the color of the folders that held the decryptions, to distinguish it from other Japanese ciphers. It used two Underwood typewriters, one for input and one for output. This helped reduce errors and manpower but came at the cost of being more cumbersome on the battlefield. The rotors were electro-mechanically rotated by "stepping switches", rather than by mechanically pressing a key. Also the typewriters were electrical, so the combined cipher system with the power needed would have been much less portable than the Enigma, or especially the M-209. Functionally, it operated like the Enigma with four rotors.

						<h2>One Time Pad</h2>
						<h3>The unbreakable code</h3>
						<code style="color:#a9a9a9">
							plaintext   : SECRETMESSAGE <br>
							one-time pad: CIJTHUUHMLFRU <br>
							ciphertext  : UMLKLNGLEDFXY
						</code>
						<aside class="notes">
							The one-time pad is a long sequence of random letters. These letters are combined with the plaintext message to produce the ciphertext. To decipher the message, a person must have a copy of the one-time pad to reverse the process. A one-time pad should be used only once (hence the name) and then destroyed. This is the first and only encryption algorithm that has been proven to be unbreakable.

To encipher a message, you take the first letter in the plaintext message and add it to the first random letter from the one-time pad. For example, suppose you are enciphering the letter S (the 19th letter of the alphabet) and the one-time pad gives you C (3rd letter of the alphabet). You add the two letters and subtract 1. When you add S and C and subtract 1, you get 21 which is U. Each letter is enciphered in this method, with the alphabet wrapping around to the begining if the addition results in a number beyond 26 (Z).

To decipher a message, you take the first letter of the ciphertext and subtract the first random letter from the one-time pad. If the number is negative you wrap around to the end of the alphabet.

						<h2>Diffie-Hellman</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Alice and Bob agree to use a modulus p = 23 and base g = 5 (which is a primitive root modulo 23).</li>
							<li>Alice chooses a secret integer a = 6, then sends Bob A = g^a mod p. A = 5^6 mod 23 = 8</li>
							<li>Bob chooses a secret integer b = 15, then sends Alice B = g^b mod p. B = 5^15 mod 23 = 19</li>
							<li>Alice computes s = B^a mod p. s = 19^6 mod 23 = 2</li>
							<li>Bob computes s = A^b mod p. s = 8^15 mod 23 = 2</li>
							<li>Alice and Bob now share a secret (the number 2).</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange Alice and Bob agree to use a modulus p=23 and base g=5. Alice chooses a secret integer a=6, then sends Bob A which equals 8 in this case. Bob chooses a secret integer b=15 then sends Alice B which equals 19 in this case. Alice computes the secret using B from Bob and her secret which = 2 and Bob does the same. Alice and Bob now share a secret, the number 2

						<h2>Disadvantage of Diffie-Hellman</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>You cannot send a message in the transition simply the result of the computation.</li>
							<li>Man in the middle attack</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="man_in_the_middle.png" height="400" />
						<aside class="notes">
							The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. In this attack, an attacker intercepts Alice's public value and sends their own public value to Bob. When Bob transmits his public value, the attacker substitutes it with their own and sends it to Alice. The attacker and Alice thus agree on one shared key and the attacker and Bob agree on another shared key. After this exchange, the attacker simply decrypts any messages sent out by Alice or Bob, and then reads and possibly modifies them before re-encrypting with the appropriate key and transmitting them to the other party. This vulnerability is present because Diffie-Hellman key exchange does not authenticate the participants. Possible solutions include the use of digital signatures and other protocol variants.

						<aside class="notes">
							The First step of RSA encryption is to generate two primes, p and q. The product of our primes in this case is 77. The euler totient is 60. Now we have to choose an exponent, e that is relatively prime to our euler totient. in this case we choose 17. Our next step is to calculate a value for d. d must be chosen so that it is the inverse of e, modulo n. So for this example d equals 53 and is our private key used to decrypt our messages. Our public key is (e,n)-17,77 and our private key is (d,n)-53,60.

						<h2>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h2>
						<img src="elliptic-curve-crypt-image02.gif" alt="" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Let's imagine this curve as the setting for a bizarre game of billiards. Take any two points on the curve and draw a line through them; the line will intersect the curve at exactly one more place. In this game of billiards, you take a ball at point A and shoot it toward point B. When it hits the curve, the ball bounces either straight up (if it's below the x-axis) or straight down (if it's above the x-axis) to the other side of the curve.
							We can call this billiards move on two points "dot." Any two points on a curve can be dotted together to get a new point.

A dot B = C

We can also string moves together to "dot" a point with itself over and over.

A dot A = B

A dot B = C

A dot C = D

						<h2>More realistic Elliptic Curve</h2>
						<img src="elliptic-curve-crypt-image04-640x476.png" alt="" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>This is the same Curve with only whole number points represented</h2>
						<img src="elliptic-curve-crypt-image01.gif" width="600"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							This hardly looks like a curve in the traditional sense, but it is. It's like the original curve was wrapped around at the edges and only the parts of the curve that hit whole number coordinates are colored in. You can even still see the horizontal symmetry.

In fact, you can still play the billiards game on this curve and dot points together. The equation for a line on the curve still has the same properties. Moreover, the dot operation can be efficiently computed. You can visualize the line between two points as a line that wraps around at the borders until it hits a point. It's like, in our bizarro billiards game, when a ball hits the edge of the board (the max) and then is magically transported to the opposite side of the table and continues on its path until reaching a point, kind of like the game Snake.
